## Abstract:

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Checking for and Installing Packages
We are going to start by identifying any packages needed for our analysis. In order to avoid any unnecessary re-installation or loading, we are going to set up a way to automatically check and then load only what we need.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Store string containing all required packages
my_packages <- c('igraph', 'RColorBrewer', 'ggplot2', 'dplyr', 'janitor', 'stringr', 'pdf_tools', 'stopwords')

```

Figure out which of these packages is already installed
``` {r}
# Store all installed packages
ya_installed <- library()$results[,1]

# Check whether required packages are already installed and grab only those that still need installation
need_install<-my_packages[!(my_packages %in% ya_installed)]

#install required packages
lapply(need_install, install.packages, character.only = TRUE)

```

Now, load only unloaded packages
``` {r}
# Store all installed packages
ya_loaded <- (.packages())

# Check whether required packages are already installed and grab only those that still need installation
need_load<-my_packages[!(my_packages %in% ya_loaded)]

# Load required packages
lapply(need_load, require, character.only = TRUE)
```
## Import the Private Security Database
```{r}
PSD <- read.csv("~/Hartnett375_FinalProject/PSD_V4_1990-2007_csv.csv", row.names=NULL, sep=";")

View(PSD)
head(PSD)
summarize(PSD)
```

# Preprocess the data
(To be converted into a matrix and graph object)
```{r}
prepped_data <- PSD %>%
  group_by(clientsc) %>%
  summarize(
    target_country = locsc
  )
View(prepped_data)
```

# Create a graph object that we can visualize
```{r}
PSD_matrix <- as.matrix(prepped_data)
#View(PSD_matrix)

PSD.g <- graph_from_edgelist(PSD_matrix, directed = TRUE)
PSD.g
```

# Assign Node and Edge attributes
```{r}
V(PSD.g)$vertex_degree <- degree(PSD.g)# Assign a degree attribute
edge_weights <- E(PSD.g)$edge_weight <- PSD$nofirm#Make edgeweights the number of firms employed
#Preliminary Visualization
lo_nice = layout_nicely(PSD.g)
plot(PSD.g, layout = lo_nice, vertex.size = log(V(PSD.g)$vertex_degree) * 6, edge.width = edge_weights, edge.arrow.size = 0.9,
     title = "Private Military Contracts by Country",
     vertex.label.color = "black")
```
Node attribute vs Edge attribute
